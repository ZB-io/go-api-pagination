Scenario 1: Testing with nil PaginatorOpts
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a nil PaginatorOpts. The function is expected to return a default ListOptions object with PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with nil PaginatorOpts.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned ListOptions object has PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's implementation which states that a default ListOptions object should be returned when a nil PaginatorOpts is passed. This test is important to ensure the function handles nil input correctly.

Scenario 2: Testing with PaginatorOpts having nil ListOptions
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a PaginatorOpts object having a nil ListOptions. The function is expected to return a default ListOptions object with PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PaginatorOpts object with a nil ListOptions.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with the created PaginatorOpts.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned ListOptions object has PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's implementation which states that a default ListOptions object should be returned when a PaginatorOpts with a nil ListOptions is passed. This test is important to ensure the function handles such input correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing with PaginatorOpts having ListOptions with PerPage set to 0
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a PaginatorOpts object having a ListOptions with PerPage set to 0. The function is expected to modify the PerPage value to 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PaginatorOpts object with a ListOptions having PerPage set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with the created PaginatorOpts.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned ListOptions object has PerPage set to 100.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's implementation which states that the PerPage value should be set to 100 if it's initially 0. This test is important to ensure the function handles such cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with valid PaginatorOpts
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a valid PaginatorOpts. The function is expected to return the same ListOptions object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid PaginatorOpts object.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with the created PaginatorOpts.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned ListOptions object is the same as the one in the provided PaginatorOpts.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's implementation which states that the same ListOptions object should be returned if the provided PaginatorOpts is valid. This test is important to ensure the function works correctly with valid input.
