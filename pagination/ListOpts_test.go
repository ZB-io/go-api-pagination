Scenario 1: Testing with nil PaginatorOpts

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a nil PaginatorOpts. The function is expected to return a default ListOptions object with PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are passing nil.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with nil as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ListOptions object has PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the function's documented behavior for nil input. This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles null input and returns a default object.

Scenario 2: Testing with a PaginatorOpts with nil ListOptions

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a PaginatorOpts object that has a nil ListOptions. The function is expected to return a default ListOptions object with PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PaginatorOpts object with a nil ListOptions.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with the PaginatorOpts object as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ListOptions object has PerPage set to 100 and Page set to 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the function's documented behavior when the ListOptions within the provided PaginatorOpts is nil. This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles cases where the input object is not null, but its ListOptions is.

Scenario 3: Testing with a PaginatorOpts with a ListOptions that has PerPage set to 0

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a PaginatorOpts object that has a ListOptions with PerPage set to 0. The function is expected to return a ListOptions object with PerPage set to 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PaginatorOpts object with a ListOptions that has PerPage set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with the PaginatorOpts object as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ListOptions object has PerPage set to 100.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the function's documented behavior when the PerPage within the provided ListOptions is 0. This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles cases where PerPage is 0 and sets it to the default value.

Scenario 4: Testing with a valid PaginatorOpts

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when it's provided with a valid PaginatorOpts object. The function is expected to return the same ListOptions object that was provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PaginatorOpts object with a valid ListOptions.
  Act: Invoke the listOpts function with the PaginatorOpts object as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ListOptions object is the same as the one that was provided.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the function's documented behavior when provided with a valid PaginatorOpts. This test is important to ensure that the function properly handles valid input and returns the correct ListOptions object.
